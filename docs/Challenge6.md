But more people "know how" to break it than can actually break it, and a similar technique breaks something much more important.

First, define a function to compute hamming distance between two strings.
```python
def hamming_distance(str1, str2):
	if len(str1) != len(str2):
		return 0
	else:
		result = 0

		for char1, char2 in zip(str1, str2):
			result = result + bin(ord(char1) ^ ord(char2)).count("1")
		return result
```

Next step is to identify the key size. The ```find_key_size()``` takes 12 chunks of the ciphertext, with each chunk varying in length between 2 and 41, and computes the highest average hamming distance for each chunk size. The function then sorts the sizes in decreasing order of hamming distances and returns a dictionary.

```python
def find_key_sizes(ciphertext):
    key_distances = {}

    for key_size in xrange(2,41):
        str_part_1 = ciphertext[0:key_size]
        str_part_2 = ciphertext[key_size:key_size*2]

        str_part_3 = ciphertext[key_size*2:key_size*3]
        str_part_4 = ciphertext[key_size*3:key_size*4]

        str_part_5 = ciphertext[key_size*4:key_size*5]
        str_part_6 = ciphertext[key_size*5:key_size*6]

        str_part_7 = ciphertext[key_size*6:key_size*7]
        str_part_8 = ciphertext[key_size*7:key_size*8]

        str_part_9 = ciphertext[key_size*8:key_size*9]
        str_part_10 = ciphertext[key_size*9:key_size*10]

        str_part_11 = ciphertext[key_size*10:key_size*11]
        str_part_12 = ciphertext[key_size*11:key_size*12]

        # key_distances[key_size] = (hamming_distance(str_part_1, str_part_2))/float(key_size)
        key_distances[key_size] = ((hamming_distance(str_part_1, str_part_2) + hamming_distance(str_part_3, str_part_4)+ hamming_distance(str_part_5, str_part_6) + hamming_distance(str_part_7, str_part_8) + hamming_distance(str_part_9, str_part_10) + hamming_distance(str_part_11, str_part_12))/float(key_size))/6

    sorted_key_distances = sorted(key_distances.items(), key=lambda kv: kv[1])
```

A function to compute the transpose of a string is also defined.
```python
def transpose(text, size):
	output = {}

	for i in xrange(size):
		output[i] = ''

	for count, char in enumerate(text):
		output[count%size] = output[count%size] + char

	return output
```
Next, the ciphertext is read from the file and base64 decoded. After identifying the key size, the ciphertext is transposed by breaking up the string as per the key size. Then, all keys are looped over and XOR'ed with each block. For each key, the best chi_squared value is considered as a potential key byte. All individually identified key bytes are combined to recreate the key. The ciphertext is then repeating-key XOR'ed with the key to get the plaintext.

```python
assert hamming_distance("this is a test", "wokka wokka!!!") == 37

min_key_size = 10000

f = open("challenge6/encrypted.txt", "r")

ciphertext = base64.b64decode(f.read())

sorted_key_distances = find_key_sizes(ciphertext)

for key_pair in sorted_key_distances[0:1]:
    print key_pair
    key_result = ""
    for key, block in transpose(ciphertext, key_pair[0]).iteritems():
        max_score = 0
        max_key = ''
        for char in string.printable:
            computed_plaintext = challenge5.repeated_xor(block, char)

            score = challenge3.compute_chi_square(computed_plaintext)

            if score > max_score:
                max_score = score
                max_key = char

        key_result = key_result + max_key

    print challenge5.repeated_xor(ciphertext, key_result)
    print "KEY: " + key_result
```
