**PKCS** in cryptography stands for "Public Key Cryptographic Standards", which are a group of standards developed for public-key cryptography. Refer to the cryptography.io page for [PKCS#7](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/hazmat/primitives/padding/) to learn more.

The padding function checks for the number of bytes to be appended to the string. The number of bytes of padding is added to the end of the plaintext to make the length of the plaintext a multiple of the blocksize.

```python
def pkcs7_pad(data, block_size):
    remaining_bytes = block_size - len(data)%block_size

    if remaining_bytes == block_size:
        return data

    for x in xrange(0, remaining_bytes):
        data = data + struct.pack('B', remaining_bytes)
    return data
```

An unpadding function is also defined as follows:
```python
def pkcs7_unpad(data):
    padding_length = struct.unpack('B', str(data[-1]))[0]

    padding = data[-padding_length:]

    if all(ord(padding[b]) == len(padding) for b in xrange(0, len(padding))):
        return data[:-len(padding)]
    else:
        return data
```

Finally to verify the functions:
```python
unpadded_data = b'YELLOW SUBMARINE'
padded_data_test = b'YELLOW SUBMARINE\x04\x04\x04\x04'

padded_data = pkcs7_pad(unpadded_data, 20)

print padded_data == padded_data_test

print pkcs7_unpad(padded_data)
```
